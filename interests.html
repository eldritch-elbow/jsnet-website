<p class="headings">Tetsudo

<p>I study an amazing Martial Art called <a href="http://www.tetsudo.co.uk">Tetsudo</a>, which
was formed in the United Kingdom but originates from Eastern martial art styles.

<p>Tetsudo teaches self control, defense, and awareness through the study of four 
areas: Basic Techniques such as kicks and punches, sequences of movements called 'Kedh',
a type of sparring called Freestyle, and breaking of solid objects such as boards, tiles
or bricks.

<p>My current grade is Senior Brown belt, and I hope to achieve black belt within the 
next two years.</p>

<p class="headings">Software Architecture

<p>Software Architecture can be seen as the significant design decisions that shape complex software 
and software systems. It's often defined in terms of components, relationships, 
and observable behaviour; more recently Grady Booch put forward a view of software architecture based 
on the 'forces' acting upon a system that shape significant design. 

<p>I worked as a software architect for Siemens Communications for two years,
it's an emerging field and a challenging line of work, but it's also one of the areas in 
software development that provides a real opportunity for creativity and the study of beauty 
and form, which is one of the things I really like about it. It's also 
a way of genuinely "making a difference" in software by tackling wider problems than those 
immediately present when simply 'writing code'.
