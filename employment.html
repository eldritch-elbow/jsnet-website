<p class="headings">Career History

<p>I studied Computing at <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk">Loughborough University</a> from 
1993 to 1997, which included one year of industrial training spent working at 
<a href="http://www-5.ibm.com/uk/locations/hursley_details.html">IBM's Laboratories in Hursley Park</a> 
near Winchester. 

<p>I graduated with a First class degree from Loughborough University in 1997, and 
spent the first three years of my working life with a small company called
Mercia software in Birmingham, working on both the sustaining and development of 
supply-chain planning software.

<p>After leaving Mercia, I got a job as a Software Engineer with 
<a href="http://www.siemens-enterprise.com/uk/">Siemens Communications</a>. During my time with Siemens
I worked on a remote telecomms management enterprise application, a train communications system, and 
Voice-Over-IP (VOIP) telephones. My final role was as a software architect on a project developing a 
new range of VOIP phones which are planned to be released in the near future.

<p>Following Siemens I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at IBM Hursley park, where my
roles covered the design and development of middleware messaging systems, including 
<a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/">WebSphere Application Server</a>,
(JMS and WS-Notification), and WebSphere Business Events 
(now <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/business-rule-management/decision-server/">WebSphere Decision Server</a>).</p>

<p>Most recently, I have joined <a href="http://www.macmillan.com/">Macmillan Publishing</a>, to develop science focussed technologies
as part of <a href="http://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a>.<p>
