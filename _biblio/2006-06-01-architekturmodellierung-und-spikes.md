summary: Agile projects aim to implement requirements into working software as quickly as possible and to regularly produce potentially deliverable product increments. However, a prerequisite for targeted development is a clear understanding of the software architecture. How much architectural modeling is necessary in agile projects? When does it take place? Who carries it out, and how much time is required? The article discusses these questions and draws on the authorsâ€™ experience with agile product development projects in the enterprise and embedded domains.
